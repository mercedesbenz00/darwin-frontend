## **🤓  SUGGESTIONS**

- [ ] Remember to properly label your PR to help reviewers (eg: 'Fire Team', 'ready for review' etc.)
- [ ] Be your own first reviewer! add comments in critical file changes
when code comments might not be enough, to explain logic/style changes
- [ ] Every time a reviewer leaves a comment or ask for updates, after you answer or implement those updates, remember to hit the refresh icon in the Reviewers section (top-right of this page) to speed up the reviewing process
