      <paragraph-12>
        <strong>Managed files</strong> include single images, extracted video
        frames, medical image slices, or single document pages that are annotated
        or in a workflow. Empty stored files are not counted in this limit. For
        example if you only label 5 images in a 100 image dataset, you are
        managing 5 files.
      </paragraph-12>
      <paragraph-12>
        1 file is assumed to be up to 25 million pixels, or up to 6 video frames.
        Files in higher resolution amount to +1 for each 25 megapixels. Video
        frames at 5fps or faster count as 1/6th of a file. Deleting files
        permanently will free up storage.

        You may edit your Annotation plan to increase your teamâ€™s managed
        allowance.
