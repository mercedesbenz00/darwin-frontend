  <header-4-stub>How are credits calculated?</header-4-stub>
  <paragraph-12-stub><strong>Human Hours</strong> count the total active annotation time in a
    team. 1 human hour = 1 credit.
    <br>When users are actively clicking to create or edit annotations,
    the time is logged. If users are only browsing images, or if the browser
    window is not focused, that time is free. If an image is browsed for a
    long time, after which an annotation is placed, only the last 60 seconds
    or fewer are logged, and any time beyond 60 seconds is free.
  </paragraph-12-stub>
  <paragraph-12-stub><strong>Automated Actions</strong> are the total uses of an automation
    system, like running a neural network, or creating an annotation with
    Auto-Annotate. 100 automated actions = 1 credit.
    <br>When using Auto-Annotate, only the creation of an annotation counts
    as an Automated Action. Editing or re-running the annotation within the
    same image or frame is free.
    <br>Running a neural network on an image, regardless of how many
    annotations the output contains, counts as 1 automation action.
    <br>Importing annotation files from an external model also counts as 1
    automated action.
  </paragraph-12-stub>
  <paragraph-12-stub><strong>Model Uptime</strong> is a sum of model training and uptime costs.
    Model training is charged at 0.33 credits / minute.
    Model uptime is charged at 2 credits / hour per instance.
  </paragraph-12-stub>
  <paragraph-12-stub><strong>1 credit</strong> costs between $1.50 and $0.60 depending on your
    monthly usage volume. Therefore, generating 100 automated polygons, or
    labelling manually and continuously for 1 hour, incurs a $1.50-0.60
    platform cost.
