      <paragraph-12-stub>
        Measured as the area of overlap between your model’s prediction and the
        ground truth, divided by their union. IoU gives an idea of how much of
        the total area of an object do your predictions tend to cover.
        Two perfectly overlapping annotations have an IoU of 100%.
      </paragraph-12-stub>
      <paragraph-12-stub>
        More passes means generally a lower expected overlap. For classification
        tags, an exact match across all stages is 100%. If 3 out of 4 agree, the
        overlap is 75%.
