  <header-4-stub>How is storage calculated?</header-4-stub>
  <paragraph-12-stub><strong>Managed files</strong> include single images, extracted video
    frames, medical image slices, or single document pages that are annotated
    or in a workflow. Empty stored files are not counted in this limit. For
    example if you only label 5 images in a 100 image dataset, you are
    managing 5 files.
  </paragraph-12-stub>
  <paragraph-12-stub>
    1 file is assumed to be up to 25 million pixels, or up to 6 video frames.
    Files in higher resolution amount to +1 for each 25 megapixels. Video
    frames at 5fps or faster count as 1/6th of a file. Deleting files
    permanently will free up storage.

    You may edit your Annotation plan to increase your teamâ€™s managed
    allowance.
