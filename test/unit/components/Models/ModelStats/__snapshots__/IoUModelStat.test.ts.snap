  <p><strong class="bold">Intersection over Union</strong>
    (IoU) is measured as the area of overlap between your modelâ€™s prediction and the ground
    truth, divided by their union. IoU gives an idea of how much of the total area of an
    object do your predictions tend to cover. Two perfectly overlapping annotations have an
    IoU of 1.00.
