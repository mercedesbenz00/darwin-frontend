  <p><strong class="bold">Precision</strong> is measured by dividing true
    positive predictions (correct ones) by true positives + false positives.
    Precision measures how often an object is correctly identified once it
    is found, and is a good measure of false positive rate (an object is
    predicted, but isn't really there) but does not take into account fales
    negatives (an object is present, but is not predicted).
    Model predictions falling below 50% IoU to the ground truth
    are considered false positives, such as the over-predicted tree in the
    diagram, which should take up a smaller area than the prediction.
