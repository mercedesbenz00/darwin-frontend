  <p><strong class="bold">Recall</strong>
    is measured by dividing true positive predictions (correct ones) by true positives +
    false negatives. Recall measures how often an object is found, and is a good measure of
    false negative rate (an objet is present, but isnâ€™t found). Present objects falling
    below 50% IoU to the ground truth are considered false negatives, such as the
    half-predicted car in the diagram.
