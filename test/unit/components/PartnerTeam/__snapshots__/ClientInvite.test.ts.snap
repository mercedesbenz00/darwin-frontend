    Generate a team invite for a customer so they may create their workspace
    on V7. This allows them to keep legal ownership of their data, make use
    of the API, and get technical support from V7. You will automatically
    become an admin of this new team, and their datasets will show up within
    this team's dataset view to yourself or any workforce manager added to them.
